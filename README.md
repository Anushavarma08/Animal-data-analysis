# Animal Care and Control Adoption Analysis

This project, developed by Team 'TailBlazers'(Anusha Mudundi & Charu Gupta) during the January Code Pudding event hosted by #[TripleTen](https://www.tripleten.com/), focuses on analyzing animal care and control adoption data. Our objective is to uncover insights into animal intake patterns, adoption rates, and factors influencing successful adoptions.

üèÜ Achievement

We are proud to announce that our team won the January Code Pudding competition hosted by TripleTen! Competing against multiple talented teams, we successfully developed and presented our findings in just five days, delivering a compelling analysis in under seven minutes.

## Project Overview

In just five intensive days, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the provided dataset, aiming to answer vital questions that could aid in improving animal welfare and shelter operations.

## Data Source

The dataset utilized for this analysis was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). This dataset provides detailed information on animal intakes and outcomes, serving as a solid foundation for our analysis

## Features

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Addressed missing values and standardized data formats to ensure accuracy.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Utilized statistical methods to identify trends and correlations within the dataset.

- **Visualization:** Created interactive dashboards using Tableau to present our findings in an accessible manner.

## Results

Our analysis revealed significant factors affecting adoption rates, such as animal age, breed, and intake conditions. These insights can inform strategies to enhance adoption processes and outcomes.

## Future Work

We plan to further refine our analysis by incorporating additional data sources and exploring predictive modeling to forecast adoption probabilities.

## Skills Developed

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Enhanced proficiency in handling missing values and standardizing data formats.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Improved ability to identify trends and correlations within datasets.

- **Data Visualization:** Advanced skills in creating interactive dashboards for effective data presentation.
